## Hi there 👋

My name is Joaquin, and I'm a full-stack backend-oriented engineer from Uruguay with a strong passion for efficiency and building (maybe) useful things. 😉

### 🚀 Highlight: Open Source Contribution

I reported a **Priority: MUST** bug in the official [Backpack for Laravel](https://backpackforlaravel.com/) repo, related to a 419 - Token Mismatch error on list operations when using AJAX. 
Although my [PR #5223](https://github.com/Laravel-Backpack/CRUD/pull/5223) wasn't merged, it helped maintainers identify the root cause, a mismatch between the expected meta tag (csrf-token) and outdated code referencing csrf_token and sending X-XSRF-TOKEN as described on [fix in PR #5255](https://github.com/Laravel-Backpack/CRUD/pull/5255) by pxpm.

It felt amazing to contribute to a project I use!
